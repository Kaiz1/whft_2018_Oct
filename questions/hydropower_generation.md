Answer: The power conversion of a typical hydropower plant occurs when the hydroplant harnesses the energy found in moving or still water and converts it into electricity. This meeans that as water flows through the hydropower plant, it produces kinetic energy. The kinetic  will then be able to be converted into mechanical energy and then the mechanical energy is coverted into electrical energy.

Answer: DC
